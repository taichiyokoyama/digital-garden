## Summary

Community Management and Social Media Management may look similar, but they serve different purposes.
Social media is about broadcasting to an audience, while community is about building relationships between members.

---

## Key Points

### 1) Community Management ≠ Social Media Management
They are often confused as the same role, but they require different mindsets, goals, and skills.

### 2) Social media is a “megaphone” — community is a “campfire”
- **Social Media Management:** one-to-many broadcasting  
  Focus: reach, awareness, traffic, leads, campaign wins  
- **Community Management:** peer-to-peer relationship building  
  Focus: belonging, loyalty, ongoing conversations, culture

### 3) Social media creates moments — community builds relationships
Social media brings people in.
Community keeps people connected and coming back.

### 4) Community is becoming a strategic business asset
Strong communities drive:
- loyalty and retention
- word-of-mouth growth
- product feedback and improvement
- deeper customer insight  
Human connection is the core value, so empathy and listening are essential.

### 5) Community work is difficult in practice
Key challenges include:
- moderation and conflict resolution
- toxicity and bad actors
- privacy and trust
- AI risks (bias, fairness, accountability)
- proving impact and securing resources

### 6) The future is “AI + deeper humanity”
AI will support repetitive tasks, while humans focus on high-value work like strategy, trust-building, and conflict management.
Expect more micro-communities and more blended online/offline experiences.

### 7) Big takeaway: less broadcasting, more bridge-building
Community Management is not just content posting.
It is the craft of creating spaces where people feel safe, seen, and connected.
