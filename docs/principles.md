# Principles

This repository is my **Digital Garden**.  
It’s not a collection of finished work—it's a place to grow notes, thoughts, and learnings over time.

## What this is
- **Digital Garden**: notes in progress. I can leave things unfinished and gradually improve them.
- **Open source**: anyone can read it (transparency + reference). I only publish what I’m comfortable sharing publicly.
- **Identity vault**: unlike social media where things disappear, this is where my values, learnings, and thinking can accumulate.

## How I publish
- **GitHub**: grow it (daily notes / weekly reflections)
- **Substack**: edit and deliver what I’ve gathered (monthly digest)
- **Social (X / Discord, etc.)**: mainly announcements & links. I generally don’t reply (only minimal replies when needed).

## Boundaries
- Everything here reflects my **personal views**.
- I write based on **public information**.
- I avoid long quotes or reposting; I mainly use **links + key points + my own words**.
- I may use **AI** for outlining, summarizing, or drafting after reading the sources.
- This is an archive of learning and references rather than a place for debates.

## One-line summary
“Grow on GitHub → deliver on Substack → use social mainly for announcements.”
